Ephemeris computation software, written between 2000 and 2002, not modified since.
Writen in java 2, still works in 2018 on a java 8 JVM.

Contains :
<ul>
    <li>Implementation of high-precision ephemeris for planets, using analytical theories of the BDL : VSOP87 (Mercury to Neptune) , ELP82 (Moon), Pluto99.</li>
    <li>Sky chart drawing</li>
</ul>

See a more detailed presentation on <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/jephem/index_en.htm">astrosurf.com/jephem</a>

Written to explore ephemeris computation and to provide a GPL alternative to Swiss Ephemeris (sweph).
Became useless when sweph became GPL. 

Published because some code can be re-used :
